###Music Data Abstraction Language

[https://utz82.github.io/MDAL]

MDAL (The Music Data Abstraction Language) is a veritable, text-based audio programming language specifically tailored for use with sound drivers operating on low-level devices such as sound chips and simple DACs.

This repository contains **libmdal**, a C++ library for parsing MDAL modules, and **mdalc**, a reference compiler implementation based on libmdal.
